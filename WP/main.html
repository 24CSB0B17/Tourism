        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Warangal is a city in the Indian state of Telangana and the district headquarters of
            Warangal district. It is the second largest city in Telangana with a population of 811,844 per 2011 Census
            of India,[3][4] and spreading over an 406 km2 (157 sq mi).[1] Warangal served as the capital of the Kakatiya
            dynasty which was established in 1163. The monuments left by the Kakatiyas include fortresses, lakes,
            temples and stone gateways which, in the present, helped the city to become a popular tourist attraction.
            The Kakatiya Kala Thoranam was included in the emblem of Telangana by the state government and Warangal is
            also touted as the cultural capital of Telangana.[5][6]

            It is one of eleven cities in the country to have been chosen for the Heritage City Development and
            Augmentation Yojana scheme by the Government of India.[7] It was also selected as a smart city in the
            "fast-track competition", which makes it eligible for additional investment to improve urban infrastructure
            and industrial opportunities under the Smart Cities Mission.[8]

            UNESCO has included Warangal in its Global Network of Learning Cities (GNLC) in recognition of the city's
            outstanding efforts to make lifelong learning a reality for all at the local level.[9]

            The three urban cities: Kazipet, Hanamkonda and Warangal are together known as Warangal Tri-City. The three
            cities are connected by the National Highway 163 (Hyderabad–Bhuvanagiri–Warangal–Bhopalpatnam). The major
            stations are Kazipet Junction railway station and Warangal railway station. lorem100 Lorem ipsum dolor sit
